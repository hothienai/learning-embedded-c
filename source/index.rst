Welcome to Ho Thien Ai's documentation!
=================================================

Hello! I'm Ai, a random embedded software engineer who loves to learn and share the good things. 

This documentation is used to document what I have learned about Embedded C programming, including basics of ``C language``, ``Embedded C concepts``, ``State Machines``, and ``All other things``. I hope that you find this resource helpful in your journey to mastering Embedded C programming. 

Thank you for visiting!
